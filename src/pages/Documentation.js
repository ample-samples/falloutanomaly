    PART 3:
    DETAILED SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
    Spoiler:  Show

    The Anomaly Team is constantly seeking ways to enhance performance across a variety of systems. Version 0.5 will feature a performance overhaul, but for the best possible experience with Fallout Anomaly, please consider the following recommended setup:

    CPU: A processor with at least 3GHz clock speed.
    GPU: A graphics card with a minimum of 6GB VRAM; 4GB graphics cards might work without ENB, but performance isn't guaranteed.
    RAM: 16GB is recommended; 32GB offers optimal performance but isn't necessary.
    Monitor: A 1440p monitor with a 144Hz refresh rate for optimal visual quality but 1080p will be just fine.
    Storage: An SSD/NVMe drive is highly recommended for faster performance. Fallout Anomaly is designed for optimization across a wide range of systems, but we cannot guarantee optimal performance on HDDs.
